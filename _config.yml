        description: |
          - Implementing Content-Centric Networking on Python by **Multithreaded Programming** 
          - Optimized the cache hit ratio by setup priority queue and SDN characteristic to the network **(Highest cache hit ratio in class)**

        title: Road Doctor
        description: |
          - Proposed an automated **mobile-based (Android)** road condition monitoring system
          - Used **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Band-pass filter** to filter the noise in the collecting data, then employed **“XGBoost”** as the primary model to classify potholes from collecting data **with 0.985 accuracy**

          - Referred to a paper posted on ICAIF 2020 about deep reinforcement learning for automated stock trading

          - Proposed a deep reinforcement ensemble trading method based on the combination of **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Advantage Actor-Critic(A2C)**, which increased cumulative return from 70.4% to 121% from Jan 2016 to May 2020 and increased Sharpe Ration from 1.30 to 1.61 compared to the approach from original method (Best final presentation in class)

        title: Smart K
        description: |
          - Used **Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors, relays, and infrared transmitter** to control the **light and air-conditioner** in the classroom
          - Implemented **Yolov3 through darknet** structure on Raspberry Pi to check for students in classroom

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
